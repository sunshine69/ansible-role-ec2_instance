Role Name
=========

A brief description of the role goes here.

Requirements
------------

Any pre-requisites that may not be covered by Ansible itself or the role should be mentioned here. For instance, if the role uses the EC2 module, it may be a good idea to mention in this section that the boto package is required.

Role Variables
--------------

* `ami_search_tags` - used by `lookup_ec2_ami` role to find the AMI on which to base the instance

Dependencies
------------

- role: lookup_ec2_ami 
to get the dict 'ami' for this role to use it in launching the instance.

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - { role: username.rolename, x: 42 }
